# Weather-Dashboard
A weather dashboard that runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS. It uses the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data for cities.

## Description
The purpose of this assignment is to create a weather application for a traveller so that they can access the weather for multiple cities and use this information to plan their trip. The development of this application required the following criteria:
* A  weather dashboard with form inputs
* The ability to search for a city and be presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city to be added to the search history
* The current weather conditions that need to be included are city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
* The UV index needs to be colour coded to indicate whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
* Future weather conditions for that city are presented as a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
* When a city in the search history is clicked the user is presented with current and future conditions for that city

## Installation
To install this project the Open Weather API was used to gather the up to date and relevant weather information and icons. The date was set using moment.js. Javascript and JQuery were used to create HTML and add info. Ajax calls were used to retrieve info from the Weather API.


## Usage
This has been deployed to the URLs

The application appears as above. Type in city name in input box then click search button. City weather information appears on the right hand side. When the city has been searched it appears as a list below the input box. Any of the cities listed can be clicked and their relevant city weather information will appear on the right side of the browser. When the delete button is clicked, the list of city names is removed.
